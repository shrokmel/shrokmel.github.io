I'm a physicist by day, designer/illustrator by night, and an engineer by training. I will complete my PhD this year in Computational Biophysics from Forschungszentrum Jülich, partly with the aid of a fellowship from Bayer Science and Education Foundation.

My research focuses on modeling and capturing cellular-scale cytoskeletal phenomena, particularly, the interaction between molecular motors and microtubules. Recently, I have been collating my computational and modeling tools that I have picked up and applying them to a variety of problems, from computational geometry to visual effects. This blog is an attempt to showcase those tools, and help those who are facing similar problems in these fields.

## A shameless self plug:
Since I'm actively looking for prospective careers in related fields, I cannot help but add the following section highlighting my skills and achievements.

I received my Bachelors and Masters in Chemical Engineering from **Johns Hopkins University** (Baltimore, MD), and **University of Pennsylvania** (Philadelphia, PA), respectively. I am currently doing my PhD in Physics in at **Forschungszentrum Jülich** (Jülich, Germany), one of the largest interdisciplinary reserach centers in Europe. For my work, I'm very grateful for the help provided by the Jülich Supercomputing Center (JSC), which houses one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world.    

I have a deep passion for computer science. I have taught myself Matlab, C++, Python and Haskell. I actively write and use both C++ and Python, and have also taught Matlab and Python to students. I have mentored students during PhD, and was employed as a teaching assistant for computationally intensive modeling and statistical analysis courses in both Bachelors and Masters.  

I give as much importance to presentation, as I do to content and accuracy. More than simply understanding and finding solutions to problems, I enjoy conveying the same information to a lay audience. This has been especially difficult and rewarding in the context of my PhD. I am an avid user of the Adobe Creative Cloud, which I use for making all plots, posters and presentations. 

So, that’s me! If you find my profile interesting, feel free to get in touch.
